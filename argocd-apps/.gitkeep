# ArgoCD Apps Directory
#
# This directory contains ArgoCD Application definitions for the App of Apps pattern.
# Each YAML file represents an application that ArgoCD will manage.
#
# File naming convention: {service-name}.yaml
# 
# When you add new applications:
# 1. Create a new YAML file following the existing pattern
# 2. Set appropriate sync wave (1-5) based on dependencies
# 3. Configure the source repository URL and path
# 4. Set the destination namespace
# 5. Commit and push changes to trigger ArgoCD sync
